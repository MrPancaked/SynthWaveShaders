# Synthwave Scene
This moving scene was made with unity, using HLSL and shader Graph. The project is not interactive so only clone the repo if you would like to play around with the HLSL code I wrote

Most useful code and some graphs are located under Assets/Materials/Shaders
Other code that I used for the Synthwave mountain generation and instantiating the long rails on the side of the road, is located under Assets/Scripts.
